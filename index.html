  improve our App and enhance user experience.

<h2>Security of Your Information</h2>

  We strive to protect your information by implementing appropriate technical
  and organizational measures. However, no method of transmission over the

<h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not
  knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that
  we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take
  steps to delete that information.

  Some data may be stored locally on your device. This includes any cross stitch
  patterns you choose to save. These patterns will not leave your phone's local
  storage unless you choose to share them.

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any
